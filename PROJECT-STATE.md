# PROJECT-STATE.md

Short, factual snapshot of where the project stands. Updated at consolidations and after gates
(per the MEMORY PROTOCOL in AGENTS.md).

- **Current phase:** Phase B - People & Patients - **IN PROGRESS**.
- **Commits:** 18 on `main` after P0B.G2 (Patients CRM core + read-logging). Phase A = 11
  (P0A.G1-G8, P0A.GM, P0A.GF, P0A.GF3), pushed to `origin/main`
  (https://github.com/Subhankhan12/careos).
- **Verified quality (from actual output):** `composer check` green - Pint `passed`,
  PHPStan level 5 `[OK] No errors`, Pest **89 passed / 285 assertions**. `npm run build` was
  not required for P0B.G2 (backend/tests only; no frontend changes). Local schema inspection on
  MariaDB 10.4.32 confirmed `patients_name_fulltext` exists as a FULLTEXT index; the local engine
  does not have the `ngram` parser installed, so the migration uses a clean fallback after trying
  `WITH PARSER ngram`.
- **Stack (verified):** Laravel 12.63.0 on PHP 8.2.12; DEV DB = `careos` on XAMPP MariaDB
  10.4.32 (127.0.0.1:3306); default DB cache/queue/session drivers; Fortify + Sanctum.
- **Proven in Phase A:**
  - Fail-closed multi-tenancy (TenantContext + BelongsToTenant; no-context queries throw).
  - Fortify auth + **mandatory TOTP MFA** + tenant identification (suspended tenants denied).
  - Org hierarchy (branches/departments) with cross-tenant FK guard.
  - Custom **RBAC** with branch-scoped assignments + `Gate::before` (super-admin sole bypass).
  - Plans (integer minor units) + feature flags + typed settings.
  - Append-only, hash-chained, monthly-partitioned `audit_events` + AuditService
    (`verifyChain`, DB UPDATE/DELETE triggers), portable on MariaDB 10.4 + MySQL 8.
  - Audit integration (auth/RBAC/config events) + read-logging + time-boxed break-glass.
  - Inertia/Vue3/TS/Tailwind v4 shell (login -> 2FA -> role redirect; app/admin landings).
  - Cross-agent memory system (AGENTS.md + memory/) as the single source of truth.
  - CI builds the frontend and runs the suite on MySQL 8 (Node 22).
- **Proven in Phase B so far:**
  - People module registered with fail-closed `staff_profiles` and `credentials`.
  - Credential expiry status is derived from `expires_on` with tenant setting
    `people.credentials.expiry_alert_days` (default 30 days); manual `revoked` is preserved.
  - `credentials:refresh-status` recomputes stored statuses idempotently; scheduling is deferred.
  - Credential create/update/revoke is audited from the app layer; staff-profile reads are not read-logged.
  - Patients module registered with fail-closed patient CRM tables: patients, contacts,
    identifiers, and coverages.
  - MRNs are generated per tenant as `MRN-000001` style values under a tenant-row `FOR UPDATE`
    lock and skip existing/soft-deleted MRNs.
  - Patient reads use the Phase A read-logging mechanism with `patient_id`; `PatientAccessReport`
    can list read audit rows for a tenant-scoped patient.
  - Patient identifiers are optional attributes, not unique dedupe/match keys (D-021).
- **Next action:** Continue Phase B. Execute only the next gate that is pasted.
